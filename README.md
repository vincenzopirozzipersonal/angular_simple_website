Project Structure  
The project uses a typical Angular project structure.  

package.json: This file lists the project dependencies and scripts.  

auth.service.ts: This service handles the authentication logic of our app, including user registration and login.  

app.module.ts: This is the main module of our application. All other modules and components are imported into this module.  

Services  
Our main service is AuthService which can be found in auth.service.ts. This service is responsible for user registration and login. It communicates with our back-end server which is currently set to run on http://localhost:8080.  

typescript  

@Injectable({  
  providedIn: 'root'  
})  
export class AuthService {  

  // Backend server URL  
  private API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080';  

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }  

  // Register new user  
  register(user: any) {  
    return this.http.post(`${this.API_URL}/auth/register`, user);  
  }  

  // Login existing user  
  login(user: any) {  
    return this.http.post(`${this.API_URL}/auth/login`, user);  
  }  

}  
Modules  
Our app has one main module, AppModule, defined in app.module.ts. This module imports various components, modules, and services. The declarations array includes the components we're using, while the imports array includes the modules we're using.

To serve the project locally, run:  

npm start  
Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200.  

Testing
